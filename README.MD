# LoveCouple Engine
*i've brought some Unity into your Love*

A work in progress engine that uses Unity documentation as refernece. In other words this engine works similar to unity,
has similar named functions and systems, but written entirely in Lua.

> It is not finished and i doubt it ever will, but it somewhat works!

## Trivia
This engine started as engine for remake of my game! i think you can still find some references in code base
